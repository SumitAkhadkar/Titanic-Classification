## Overview
This repository contains code and data for a machine learning project aimed at predicting whether passengers on the Titanic survived or not. The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history, and this project uses machine learning techniques to analyze passenger data and make predictions about their survival.

## Background
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is a well-known historical event that occurred on April 15, 1912. Many factors, such as passenger class, age, gender, and more, contributed to whether a passenger survived or not. In this project, we aim to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a given passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on these factors.

## Data
The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which includes information about passengers such as name, age, gender, passenger class, ticket fare, and more. The dataset is available in the data directory. You can also download it from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset).

## Features
The dataset includes the following features:

- PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
- Pclass: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
- Name: Passenger's name
- Sex: Passenger's gender
- Age: Passenger's age
- SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
- Ticket: Ticket number
- Fare: Ticket fare
- Cabin: Cabin number
- Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling, are detailed in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Machine Learning Model
I've use a machine learning model (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) to predict passenger survival based on the provided features. You can find the model implementation in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using relevant metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which are explained in the Jupyter Notebook.
